# üõí BlinkIT Sales Analysis Dashboard  

## üìå Project Overview  
The BlinkIT Sales Analysis Dashboard is designed to explore and visualize grocery sales data from BlinkIT. The project aims to uncover meaningful insights into:

Product performance ‚Äì identifying top-selling and underperforming items

Customer preferences ‚Äì analyzing buying patterns across different product categories

Outlet performance ‚Äì comparing sales across various outlet types, sizes, and locations

The analysis is presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing stakeholders to track sales performance, monitor trends, and make data-driven business decisions effectively.

## üéØ Problem Statement  
BlinkIT wants to optimize its sales strategy by identifying:  
- Which products contribute most to revenue.  
- How **fat content** and **item type** impact sales.  
- Which outlets perform best and why.  
- How outlet size, location, and type influence performance.
- The challenge was to clean, model, and visualize the dataset effectively so decision-makers can quickly identify growth opportunities.
